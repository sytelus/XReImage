Let's create following single page HTML app that runs entirely on client using Option 1. The app should look slick
  and professional. The purpose of the app is to resize image properly so that it can put in a tweet. Currently if
  image is not of the proper proportion that x.com UX shows cropped version which looks very odd. We want image to
  fully appear without x.com UX unnaturally cropping it. First you would conduct ressearch on requirements for image to look good without it getting unnaturally cropped. Save your research in RESEARCH.md file. Then you will implement the simplest idea from your research in a single page HTML file that entirely runs on client side. User should be able to copy/past OR upload OR drag and drop image on this HTML page, press the button to perform necessory processing and then either copy/paste or download or drag and drop image from the page. If needed, provide customization options such as adding transperency, color, border, shadow, file format, compression and anything else that you can. Before writing code, first you will create REQUIREMENTS.md that has minimal list of the requirements for this project and then PLAN.md that contains your plan. Then you will execute this plan. Make sure you initialize new repo and create all standard files such as .gitignore, LICENSE, README.md etc. Use the best coding practices and document your code so that future maintainer can understand it without having to ask anyone. Mke sure README.md throughly documents introduction, approach and how to use for non-technical as well as technical users. Conduct research on best way to implement all of this and make sure to add it in RESEARCH.md.
